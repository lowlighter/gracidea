**Gracidea** is a cartographic project which aims to gather all known *Pokémon* regions into a single 2D live map. It tries to keep fidelity to games and fill blanks based on anime, manga, artworks and custom maps.

### ![](/client/static/copyrighted/imgs/icons/pokedoll.png) Features

**Gracidea** is not an ordinary world map! See below a short list of the awesome features embedded in it :

* **Faithful maps** : Maps are based first on core games and then filled with region knowledge and interpretations
* **Wild areas** : *Pokémon* can spawn in wild areas! If you're lucky you may see rare encounters and even shinies!
* **Liveful cities** : Humans and trainers populate the *Pokémon* world!
* **World map** : A mini-map lets you access cities and special locations quickly
* *New features will be implemented at a later date !*

### ![](/client/static/copyrighted/imgs/icons/map.png) Maps

Since there are often map redesigns in *Pokémon* franchise, the following games were chosen to represent each region:
* **Kanto** : *Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen*
* **Hoenn** : *Pokémon Emerald*
* *Others regions will follow at a later date !*

Note that some versions include 3D graphics, so these are interpretations of what they could have been if they were in 2D.

## ![](/client/static/copyrighted/imgs/icons/contribute.png) Contributing

The *Pokémon* world is really huge, and so is the amount of work needed to map it.

Whether you want to complete the mapping, provide new sprites or improve code, please read our [contributions guideline](/CONTRIBUTING.md) and open a [pull request](https://github.com/lowlighter/gracidea/pulls)!

⚠️ Note that *Gracidea* is **NOT A GAME PROJECT**, only an artistic project. All suggestion related to introduction of game mechanics (player, battles, captures, etc.) will be **systematically rejected**.

## ![](/client/static/copyrighted/imgs/icons/note.png) Note from the cartographer

I wanted to do something like a *Google maps* but for *Pokémon* games, and this is what gave birth to this project.
I hope you'll be able to enjoy and (re)discover this marvellous franchise with this extensive map !
