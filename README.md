**Gracidea** is a project which aims to gather all known *Pokémon* regions into a single 2D map, keeping fidelity to core games while taking the liberty to fill blanks trough official artworks and anime. Minors arrangements are sometimes made so everything fits.

### Features

**Gracidea** is not an ordinary world map ! See below a short list of the awesome features embedded in it :

* **Faithful maps** : Maps are based first on core games and then filled with region knowledge and interpretations
* **Wild areas** : *Pokémon* can spawn in wild areas ! Maybe you'll be able to see rare encounters ?
* **Liveful cities** : Humans are also present !
* **World map** : A world map for quick access to cities and special locations will help you to navigate faster
* **Integrated wiki** : Some elements are interactive (like *Pokémon*s) and will open the associated bulbapedia entry !
* **Reactive GPS** : Current location and coordinates are displayed so you never get lost !
* **Customisable interface** : Most of options can be passed through URL so you can easily share your favorites locations with your friends !
* *New features will be implemented at a later date !*

### Maps

Since *Pokémon* franchise has remakes, third versions and sequels, it sometimes results in redesigns in maps.
Also, as the core games switched to 3D graphics starting on generation 6 and onwards, the maps of newer regions are interpretations of what they could have been if they were in 2D. 

Here are the games which were chosen for representing each region : 
* **Kanto** : *Pokémon FireRef and LeafGreen*
* **Hoenn** : *Pokémon Emerald*
* *Others regions will follow at a later date !*

The *Pokémon* world is huge, and so is the amount of work needed to map it. Wether you want to complete the mapping, provide new sprites or propose new features, you're encouraged to open a pull request ! 

And if you're not very talented apart from knowing your type advantages, you can always reports bugs and other stuff in issues !

#### Additional notes

* You can fork this repo, but if you're making a feature which could be integrated in the [original repo](https://github.com/lowlighter/gracidea), you're encouraged to submit a pull request so everyone can enjoy it !
* Note however that this is only a mapping project, not a game project. Thus, suggestions like adding battles, captures, gym badges, story progression, and other stuff like this will always been rejected. 
* Despite *Gracidea* being based on *Pokémon* franchise, its code must be able to be dissociated from it (this is why the code never mentions *Pokémon* directly, except in documentation). This means that in case of legal issues with the usage of the franchise, licensed sprites will be removed from repo but the code can be kept intact.
* The maintainers of this repo cannot be held responsible of the usage of it from other users.
* **Star** this repo if you like it !

I always thought 2D *Pokémon* games had their own charm, and this is what gave birth to this project. 
I hope you'll be able to enjoy and (re)discover this marvellous franchise with this extensive map !
